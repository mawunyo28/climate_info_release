# Climate Info Release Repository

## Steps to run the website

1. Go to [climate_info_release](https://github.com/mawunyo28/climate_info_release)
2. Download source code as zip
3. Extract the zip file (anywhere is fine)
4. Launch the server.exe included. **Ignore any command prompts that open**
5. In a new web browser tab, in the address bar, type __localhost:8080__

## VERY IMPORTANT
I gave up on adding a backend so I instead made an article-like frontend only website using my favorite programming language 
__*`rust`*__

I realized I am not a UI/UX expert (that is not my domain anyway).

Anyway Enjoy!!
